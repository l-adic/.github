# ℓ-adic

ℓ-adic is building novel methods for zero-knowledge computing through the application of mathematics, programming language theory, and rigorous software engineering. 

We apply advanced methods in functional programming to compile langauges like Haskell to arithmetic constraint representations. We are targeting modern proving protocols as well as established Ethereum compatible protocols.
