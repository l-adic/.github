# ℓ-adic

ℓ-adic is building novel methods for verifiable computing through the application of mathematics and programming language theory. Concretely we apply advanced methods in functional programming to compile langauges like Haskell to arithmetic constraint representations.

We are targeting modern proving protocols as well as established Ethereum compatible protocols such as Groth16.
